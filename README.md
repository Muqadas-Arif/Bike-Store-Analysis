# Bike Store Sales Analysis – SQL & Python Portfolio Project

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**A complete end-to-end data analysis project** using Microsoft SQL Server, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and real-world retail bike store data.

### Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a fictional bike store chain (BikeStores database).  
Goal: Understand sales trends, identify top performers, diagnose performance drivers, and provide actionable business recommendations.

**Key Questions Answered:**
- What are the overall sales trends and peak months?
- Which stores, products, and categories drive the most revenue?
- Why do sales peak in April and crash in May?
- How does discount strategy impact revenue?

### Tech Stack
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)
- **Languages**: SQL (queries, joins, aggregations), Python 3.11
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy, pyodbc
- **Tools**: VS Code + Jupyter Notebook, SSMS


### Key Findings (Descriptive + Diagnostic)

- **Total Revenue**: ~$10M+ across 2016–2018
- **Peak Month**: April (highest revenue ~$800k in combined data)
- **Major Drop**: May (sharp decline to near zero in some years)
- **Top Store**: Baldwin Bikes (~$5.2M revenue, strong across categories)
- **Top Category**: Bikes (dominant revenue driver)
- **Discount Insight**: Higher discounts (18–20%) correlate with lower order revenue

**Diagnostic Highlights:**
- April peaks due to higher order volume, unique customers, and high-value product sales.
- May crashes likely due to seasonal demand drop (post-spring lull).
- Stores with moderate discounts (8–12%) perform better than high-discount ones.

### Business Recommendations
1. **Maximize April** – Increase inventory of high-value bikes, run spring promotions.
2. **Prevent May Drop** – Offer early summer discounts or loyalty programs in April.
3. **Discount Optimization** – Keep discounts in 8–12% range; high discounts reduce revenue.
4. **Store Improvement** – Replicate Baldwin Bikes’ strategy (better category mix, staff training).
5. **Category Focus** – Prioritize Bikes category; boost weak categories in low-performing stores.
